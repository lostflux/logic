\begin{problem}
  Suppose our language contains the equality symbol,
  constant symbol $0$, and no other parameters,
  and our structure $\frakA$ is defined by setting $\abs{\frakA} = \N$,
  and $c^\frakA = 0$.
  Which sets of natural numbers are definable in this structure?

  \begin{Answer}
    By definition;
    $\abs{\frakA} = \N$ and
    $c^\frakA = 0$.
    
    \step
    First, $0 \in \abs{\frakA}$ (since $\frakA$ assigns
    $c^\frakA$ to a member of $\abs{\frakA}$).

    \step
    We also have a two-place predicate symbol $=$,
    but we do not have a ``forall'' quantifier so we cannot
    enforce the predicate on every member of $\abs{\frakA}$.
    Therefore, all sets $S \subseteq \N$ such that $0 \in S$ are
    definable in the structure.
  \end{Answer}
\end{problem}

  \step
  The textbook gives an example that, on the structure
  $(\R, <)$, a function $h$ is an automorphism if it is strictly increasing
  (i.e. $a < b \implies h(a) < h(b)$),
  e.g. $h(a) = a^3$,
  but that $\N$ is not definable in this structure since
  $h$ maps elements out of $\N$ into $\N$.
  I don't fully understand what this means.

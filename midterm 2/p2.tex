\begin{problem}

In each case, either show without using the Completeness Theorem that
$\varphi \deduces \psi$, or else show that $\varphi \not\models \psi$.
Here $P$ and $Q$ are one-place predicate symbols.

To show $\varphi \deduces \psi$, you may use any of the metatheorems of Section 2.4.  You do not need to give an actual deduction.

For this problem, if you want to give an example of a structure and variable
assignment satisfying some particular formula $\gamma$,
it is enough to specify the structure and variable assignment.
You do not have to formally prove that $\gamma$ is satisfied.

\begin{problem}
  Show carefully and formally, directly from the formal definition of satisfaction
  \footnote{
    I repeat, directly from the formal, recursive definition of satisfaction,
    given on the bottom of page 83 and the top of page 84 in the textbook.
    In particular, this problem  is about logical validity, and not about deductions.
  },
  that the sentence $$ \forall x\,  Pxfc \rightarrow \exists x Pxfx$$
  (where $c$ is a constant symbol, $f$ is a one-place function symbol,
  and $P$ is a two-place predicate symbol) is logically valid.

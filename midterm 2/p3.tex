  Let $\cL$ be a reasonable
  \footnote{
    This means reasonable in Enderton's sense;
    see page 142.}
  language for first-order logic, and let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two theories of
  $\calL$.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Show that $T_1 \cap T_2$ is also a theory.\\
      (Recall that a set of sentences $T$ is a theory iff,
      for every sentence $\sigma$, we have
      $(T \deduces \sigma \;\implies\; \sigma \in T)$.)
    
    \begin{Answer}

    \end{Answer}

    \item Suppose that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both 
      axiomatizable, complete, consistent theories of $\mathcal L$.
      Which of the following must be true?
      
      \step
      If true, explain why; if false, give a counterexample.

      \begin{enumroman}
        \item $T_1 \cap T_2$ is consistent.

\begin{problem}
  Show there is a countable structure $\frakB$ for $\calL$
  that is elementarily equivalent to $\frakA$
  and has the following property:
  There is an element $a \in \abs{\mathfrak B}$ such that
  $\{ b \in \abs{\mathfrak B} \mid 0^\frakB <^\frakB b <^\frakB a \}$
  is infinite.

  \step
  For this problem, you do not have to be too formal about
  justifying claims like
  ``every model of $\sigma$ has property $\Phi$'' or
  ``$\frakC$ with variable assignment $s$ satisfies $\alpha$.''
  
  \step
  For example, if $\sigma$ is $\exists x \, \exists y \, x \neq y$,
  it is obvious that every model of $\sigma$ has size at least $2$
  and that $\frakA$ is a model of $\sigma$; you need not prove this.

\begin{problem}
  Write formulas that define the following sets in $\fA$.  

  \step
  Be sure your formulas have the correct free variables.
  Also be sure to notice that this language has only two
  nonlogical symbols other than $\forall$, namely $0$ and $<$.
  
  \step
  This is a short answer problem; you do not need to prove
  that your formulas define the sets they are supposed to define.

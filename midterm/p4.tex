\begin{problem}
  Define a relation $\equiv$ on $(\N^+)^2 = \set{(x, y) : x, y \in \N^+}$ by
  \[ (x_1, y_1) \equiv (x_2, y_2) \Iff x_1y_2 = x_2y_1. \]
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Show that $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $(\N^+)^2$.
    \item Describe the equivalence class of $(3, 3)$
      (do this without mentioning the equivalence relation $\equiv$).
    \item Suppose that we try to define a function on equivalence classes by
      \[ f[(x, y)] = [(2x^2, 2y^2)]. \]
      Either show that this function is well-defined or show that it is not.

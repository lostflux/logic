\begin{problem}
  We define the difference of two sets $X$ and $Y$,
  written $X - Y$, to be the set of all members of $X$
  that are not members of $Y$.
  Suppose $X$ is an effectively enumerable set of expressions
  and $Y$ is a decidable set of expressions.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Show that $X - Y$ is effectively enumerable.
    \item Suppose that $X$ is not decidable, and $X \subseteq Y$,
      show that $Y - X$ is not effectively enumerable.
  \end{enumalph}

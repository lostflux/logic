\begin{problem}
  This is a problem in sentential logic.

  \step
  Suppose that $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are wffs
  such that $\alpha \models \beta$ and $\alpha \models \lnot \gamma$.
  Show that $\alpha \models \lnot \gamma$.

  \step
  \emph{
    Please do this formally, by showing that every truth assignment that
    satisfies $\alpha$ also satisfies $(\lnot \beta)$.
    You will be graded on whether you have a
    correct proof of this kind.
  }

\begin{problem}
This is a problem in sentential logic.

\step
Let $v$ be a truth assignment on the set of sentence symbols.
For any wff $\alpha$, let;
\begin{enumroman}
  \item $f(\alpha)$ denote the number of occurrences of
    $\iff$ in $\alpha$.
  \item $g(\alpha)$ denote the number of occurrences in $\alpha$
    of sentence symbols $A_i$ for which $v(A_i) = T$.
\end{enumroman}
For example, if $v(A_1) = T$ and $v(A_2) = F$,
and $\alpha$ is $((A_1 \land A_2) \lto \lnot A_1)$,
then $g(\alpha) = 2$.
\begin{enumalph}
  \item Give careful definitions of $f(\alpha)$ and $g(\alpha)$
    by recursion on $\alpha$.
  \item Prove (carefully and formally) by induction on $\alpha$
    that if $\iff$ is the only connective symbol occurring in $\alpha$,
    then $\vbar(\alpha) = T$ if and only if $f(\alpha)$ and $g(\alpha)$
    have the opposite parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).
\end{enumalph}

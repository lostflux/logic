\begin{problem}
  This is a problem in sentential logic.

  \step
  Let $v$ be a truth assignment on the set of sentence symbols.
  For any wff $\alpha$, let;
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item $f(\alpha)$ denote the number of occurrences of
      $\iff$ in $\alpha$.
    \item $g(\alpha)$ denote the number of occurrences in $\alpha$
      of sentence symbols $A_i$ for which $v(A_i) = T$.
  \end{enumroman}
  For example, if $v(A_1) = T$ and $v(A_2) = F$,
  and $\alpha$ is $((A_1 \land A_2) \lto \lnot A_1)$,
  then $g(\alpha) = 2$.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Give careful definitions of $f(\alpha)$ and $g(\alpha)$
      by recursion on $\alpha$.
      \begin{Answer}
        \begin{align*}
          f(\alpha) &=
            \begin{cases}
              0 & \text{if $\alpha$ is a sentence symbol} \\
              f(\alpha_1) & \text{if $\alpha$ is $\lnot \alpha_1$ for some wffs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$} \\
              f(\alpha_1) + f(\alpha_2) + 1 & \text{if $\alpha$ is $\alpha_1 \iff \alpha_2$ for some wffs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$} \\
              f(\alpha_1) + f(\alpha_2) & \text{if $\alpha$ is $\alpha_1 \ast \alpha_2$ for some wffs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$} \\
            \end{cases} \\
          g(\alpha) &=
            \begin{cases}
              0 & \text{if $\alpha$ is a sentence symbol and $v(\alpha) = F$} \\
              1 & \text{if $\alpha$ is a sentence symbol and $v(\alpha) = T$} \\
              g(\alpha_1) & \text{if $\alpha$ is $\lnot \alpha_1$ for some wff $\alpha_1$} \\
              g(\alpha_1) + g(\alpha_2) &
                \text{if $\alpha$ is $\alpha_1 \ast \alpha_2$ where $\ast$ is a binary logical connective.}\\
            \end{cases}
        \end{align*}
      \end{Answer}
    \newpage
    \item Prove (carefully and formally) by induction on $\alpha$
      that if $\iff$ is the only connective symbol occurring in $\alpha$,
      then $\vbar(\alpha) = T$ if and only if $f(\alpha)$ and $g(\alpha)$
      have the opposite parity (i.e., one is even and the other is odd).

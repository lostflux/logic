\begin{problem}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
      \item Explain why the intersection of two effectively
      enumerable sets is again effectively enumerable.
      \begin{Answer}
        Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two effectively enumerable sets, then:
        \begin{enumroman}
          \item We can list members of $A$ (by definition of effective
            enumeration), and every member of $A$ will eventually
            be listed.
          \item We can list members of $B$ in the same manner.
        \end{enumroman}

        \step
        Since all members of $A \cap B$ are members of both $A$ and $B$,
        we can list members of $A \cap B$ by listing members of $A$,
        listing members of $B$,
        and comparing which elements show up in both listings.
      \end{Answer}
  \end{enumalph}

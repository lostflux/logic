\begin{problem}[5]
  Show that the formula
  \[ x = y \to P zfx \to P z fy  \]
  (where $f$ is a one-place function symbol and $P$ is a two-place predicate symbol)
  is valid.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Suppose the formula is not valid.
  Then there exists some structure $\frakA$ and some variable assignment $s$ such that
  $\not \models_{\frakA} x = y \to P zfx \to P z fy$,
   meaning:
  \begin{align}
    \models_{\frakA} (x = y) [s] \\
    \models_{\frakA} P zfx [s]~\label{eq:5a} \\
    \not \models_{\frakA} P z fy [s] ~\label{eq:5b}
  \end{align}
  Since $\models_{\frakA} (x = y) [s]$, we have that $\sbar(x) = \sbar(y)$.

  \step
  However, since $\sbar(x) = \sbar(y)$, we have that $\sbar(fx) = \sbar(fy)$:
  \[ \sbar(fx) = f^{\frakA}(\sbar(x)) = f^{\frakA}(\sbar(y)) = \sbar(fy). \]

  \step
  Therefore, $P z fx [s]$ and $P z fy [s]$ are logically equivalent,
  so ~\ref{eq:5a} and ~\ref{eq:5b} are a contradiction,
  meaning that the formula is valid and any structure which does not satisfy
  the formula is inconsistent.
\end{Answer}

\begin{problem}[26]
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Consider a fixed structure $\frakA$ and define its \emph{elementary type}
      to be the class of structures elementarily equivalent to $\frakA$.
      Show that this class is $\text{EC}_{\Delta}$.

      \step
      \emph{Hint:} Show that it is Mod Thm $\frakA$
      \begin{Answer}
        By definition, two structures $\frakA$ and $\frakB$ are elementarily equivalent
        if whenever $\models_\frakA \phi$, we also have that $\models_\frakB \phi$.
        That is, whenever $\phi$ is tautologically implied by $\frakA$
        then it is also tautologically implied by $\frakB$.

        \step
        Let $[\frakA]$ be the class of all structures elementarily
        equivalent to $\frakA$,
        and let Thm $\frakA$ be the set of all consequences of $\frakA$.
        Then every structure $\frakB$ in $[\frakA]$ is a model of Thm $\frakA$,
        since it must satisfy all the consequences of $\frakA$.
        Therefore, $[\frakA] = \text{Mod Thm } \frakA$,
        so it is $\text{EC}_{\Delta}$.
      \end{Answer}

    \item Call a class $\calK$ of structures \emph{elementarily closed} or ECL
      if whenever a structure belongs to $\calK$ then all elementarily equivalent
      structures also belong.
      Show that any such class is a union of EC$_\Delta$ classes.
      (A class that is a union of EC$_\Delta$ classes is said to be an EC$_{\Delta \Sigma}$ class;
      this notation is derived from topology.)
      \begin{Answer}
        Let $K$ be an ECL class,
        and $\frakA$ be a structure in $K$.
        Since $\frakA \in K$, $K$ satisfies all the consequences of $\frakA$,
        i.e. $\text{Mod Thm } \frakA \subseteq K$.

        \step
        Let $\frakB$ be an elementarily equivalent structure to $\frakA$.
        This means that $\frakB$ is a model of Thm $\frakA$.
        However, $K$ is elementarily closed, so
        $\frakB$ must also be in $K$,
        meaning $\text{Mod Thm }\frakB \subseteq K$.
        
        \step
        By extension, every other structure $\frakD_i$ that is elementarily
        equivalent to some structure $\frakD$ that belongs in $K$
        must also belong in $K$.
        Therefore;
        \[ \mathcal{K} = \text{Mod Thm }\frakA \cup \text{Mod Thm }\frakB \cup \text{Mod Thm }\frakD_1 \cup \text{Mod Thm }\frakD_2 \cup \ldots \]
        for every other structure $\frakD_i$ in $K$,
        so it is EC$_{\Delta \Sigma}$.
      \end{Answer}

    \item Conversely show that any class that is the union of EC$_\Delta$ classes
      is ECL.
      \begin{Answer}
        Let $K$ be a class that is EC$_{\Delta \Sigma}$.
        Then
        \[ K = \bigcup_{\frakA \text{ belongs in } K} \text{Mod Thm } \frakA. \]
        Consequently, whenever a structure $\frakA$ belongs in $K$,
        $\text{Mod Thm }\frakA \subseteq K$.
        
        \step
        Take any structure $\frakB$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\frakA$,
        then $\frakB$ tautologically implies the same set of consequences as $\frakA$,
        i.e. $\text{Mod Thm }\frakB = \text{Mod Thm } \frakA$.
        Therefore, $\text{Mod Thm }\frakB \subseteq K$
        so $\frakB$ also belongs in $K$.
        Therefore, $K$ is ECL.
      \end{Answer}

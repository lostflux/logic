    \item Consider a fixed structure $\frakA$ and define its \emph{elementary type}
      to be the class of structures elementarily equivalent to $\frakA$.
      Show that this class is $\text{EC}_{\Delta}$.

      \step
      \emph{Hint:} Show that is is Mod Thm $\frakA$
      \begin{Answer}
        By definition, two structures $\frakA$ and $\frakB$ are elementarily equivalent
        if $\models_\frakA \phi \Iff \models_\frakB \phi$ for all formulas $\phi$.
        Therefore, the elementary type of $\frakA$ is the class of all structures $\frakB$
        such that 
      \end{Answer}

    \item Call a class $\calK$ of structures \emph{elementarily closed} or ECL
      if whenever a structure belongs to $\calK$ then all elementarily equivalent
      structures also belong.
      Show that any such class is a union of EC$_\Delta$ classes.
      (A class that is a union of EC$_\Delta$ classes is said to be an EC$_{\Delta \Sigma}$ class;
      this notation is derived from topology.)

    \item Conversely show that any class that is the union of EC$_\Delta$ classes
      is ECL.

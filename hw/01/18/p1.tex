% \begin{problem}
%   Prove Theorem 17F:
%   \emph{
%     A set of expressions is decidable iff
%     both it and its complement 
%     (relative to the set of all expressions)
%     are effectively enumerable.
%   }

%   \step
%   Remark: Two semidecision procedures make a whole.

% \begin{Answer}
%   Let $\Sigma$ be a set of expressions,
%   with $\Gamma$ as its complement.

%   \step
%   We first prove that if $\Sigma$ is decidable
%   then both $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$
%   are effectively enumerable:

%   \noindent
%   Suppose $\Sigma$ is decidable, then we can always determine
%   whether a wff $\alpha$ is in $\Sigma$ or is not in $\Sigma$.
%   Therefore, we can implement an enumeration algorithm
%   as follows:
%   \begin{enumroman}
%     \item Pick an arbitrary wff, $\beta$, that has not yet been listed as a member of $\Sigma$ or $\beta$.
%     \item If $\beta \in \Sigma$, then list it as an element of $\Sigma$.
%     \item However, if $\beta \not\in \Sigma$, then list it as an element of $\Gamma$.
%     \item Repeat from step $1$.
%   \end{enumroman}
  
%   \bigskip
%   \step
%   We then prove that if both $\Sigma$ and its complement,
%   $\Gamma$, are effectively enumerable then $\Sigma$ is decidable.
  
%   \noindent
%   Assume that both $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are effectively enumerable.
%   Then, by definition of effectively enumeration,
%   we may list members of $\Sigma$ and non-members of $\Sigma$
%   (i.e. members of $\Gamma$),
%   and every member or non-member will eventually be listed in the appropriate category
%   even if the enumeration might never end in the case of an infinite $\Sigma$ or $\Gamma$.
%   Consequently, by checking the listed wffs we may always determine
%   whether a wff $\beta$ is in $\Sigma$ or not in $\Sigma$, implying that $\Sigma$ is decidable.

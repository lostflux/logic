\begin{problem}
  Assume that we have a language with the following parameters:
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item $\forall$, intended to mean, ``for all things'';
    \item $N$, intended to mean ``is a number'';
    \item $I$, intended to mean ``is interesting''; 
    \item $<$, intended to mean ``is less than''; and
    \item $0$, a constant symbol intended to denote zero.
  \end{enumroman}

  \step
  Translate back into good English the wff 
  \[ \forall x (Nx \to Ix \to \lnot \forall y(Ny \lto Iy \lto \lnot x < y)) \]
  \begin{Answer}
    Everything that is a number and is interesting is NOT greater than or equal to every interesting number.
    
    \step
    Equivalently,
    every interesting number is less than some interesting number.

    \step
    Equivalently,
    for every interesting number, there exists
    some interesting number that is less than it.
  \end{Answer}
\end{problem}

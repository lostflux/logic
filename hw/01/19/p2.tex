\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be the set of all wffs of sentential logic
  and $\equiv$ be tautological equivalence.
  Define a binary ($2$-place) function on equivalence classes,
  which we could call conjunction, by
  \[ [\alpha ] \bigland [\beta ] = [\alpha \land \beta ] \]
Prove that this function is well-defined.

\step
\emph{
  As you do this, at some point you are going to have to prove that two
  wffs are tautologically equivalent.\\
  For this exercise, please do this by showing
  explicitly that any truth assignment that satisfies one of the formulas also
  satisfies the other, and conversely.\\
  You may think itâ€™s obvious that these wffs are tautologically equivalent.
  I agree, and after this proof, you can get away with saying so, or giving a
  more informal explanation, in similar circumstances.

\begin{Answer}
%   Let $[\alpha]$ be an equivalence class with the members
%   $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$,
%   and let $[\beta]$ be an equivalence class with the members
%   $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_m$ for some $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$.
%   By definition of equivalence classes,
%   $\alpha_i \equiv \alpha_j$ (so $\vbar(\alpha_i) = \vbar(\alpha_j))$ for all $i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$,
%   and $\beta_i \equiv \beta_j$ (so $\vbar(\beta_i) = \vbar(\beta_j))$ for all $i, j \in \{1,\ldots, m\}$.
%   This means that the value of $\vbar(\alpha \land \beta)$ is the same
%   for all $\alpha \in [\alpha]$ and for all $\beta \in [\beta]$.
%   Equivalently, $(\alpha_i \land \beta_k) \equiv (\alpha_j \land \beta_l)$
%   for all $\alpha_i, \alpha_j \in [\alpha]$ and for all $\beta_k, \beta_l \in [\beta]$.

  \step
  Let $v$ be a truth assignment.\\
  Suppose that $v(\alpha) = x \in \set{T, F}$, then $v(\alpha_i) = T$ for all $\alpha_i$ in the
  equivalence relation $[\alpha]$.\\
  Similarly, suppose that $v(\beta) = y \in \set{T, F}$, then $v(\beta_j) = T$ for all $\beta_j$ in the
  equivalence relation $[\beta]$.
  Then;
  \begin{align*}
    \vbar(\alpha_i \land \beta_j) = \vbar(\alpha \land \beta) = x \land y = \begin{cases}
      T & \text{if } x = y = T \\
      F & \text{ otherwise }
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}

  \step
  Therefore, any truth assignment assigns the same value to
  $(\alpha_i \land \beta_j)$ for all $\alpha_i \in [\alpha]$ and for all $\beta_j \in [\beta]$,
  so the function is well defined.

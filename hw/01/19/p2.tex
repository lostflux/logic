\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be the set of all wffs of sentential logic
  and $\equiv$ be tautological equivalence.
  Define a binary ($2$-place) function on equivalence classes,
  which we could call conjunction, by
  \[ [\alpha ] \bigland [\beta ] = [\alpha \land \beta ] \]
Prove that this function is well-defined.

\step
\emph{
  As you do this, at some point you are going to have to prove that two
  wffs are tautologically equivalent.
}
  
\step
\emph{
  For this exercise, please do this by showing
  explicitly that any truth assignment that satisfies one of the formulas also
  satisfies the other, and conversely.
}

\step
\emph{
  You may think itâ€™s obvious that these wffs are tautologically equivalent.
  I agree, and after this proof, you can get away with saying so, or giving a
  more informal explanation, in similar circumstances.
}

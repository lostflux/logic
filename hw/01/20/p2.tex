\begin{problem}[9]
  Suppose that $X$ is a set and $\le$ is a preordering of $X$.
  Define a new binary relation on $X$ by
  \[ x \equiv y \iff (x \le y \land  y \le x). \]
  Show that $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $X$,
  that $\le$ induces a well-defined relation on equivalence classes,
  and that this induced relation is a partial ordering of $X/\equiv$.

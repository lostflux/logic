\begin{problem}[8]
  Assume that $\Sigma$ is a set of sentences such that for any
  sentence $\tau$, either $\Sigma \models \tau$ or $\Sigma \models \lnot \tau$.
  Assume that $\frakA$ is a model of $\Sigma$.
  
  \step
  Show that for any sentence $\tau$, we have $\models_{\frakA} \tau$
  \emph{iff} $\Sigma \models \tau$.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Since $\fA$ is a model for $\Sigma$, $\fA$ must agree wth $\Sigma$
  on all sentences in $\Sigma$.

  \bigskip
  \step
  ($\Rightarrow$)
  For any sentence $\tau$, suppose $\models_{\fA} \tau$.
  Since $\fA$ is a model for $\Sigma$,
  there must be a finite $\Sigma_0 \subseteq \Sigma$ such that
  $\Sigma_0 \deduces \tau$.
  This implies that $\Sigma_0 \models \tau$,
  so $\Sigma \models \tau$.

  \bigskip
  \step
  ($\Leftarrow$)
  Now suppose $\not \models_{\fA} \tau$.
  Since $\fA$ is a model for $\Sigma$,
  this implies that no finite subset $\Sigma_0 \subseteq \Sigma$ can deduce $\tau$,
  so $\Sigma_0 \not \deduces \tau$ implying $\Sigma_0 \not \models \tau$
  for all $\Sigma_0 \in \calP(\Sigma)$.
  However, if no finite subset of $\Sigma$ can deduce $\tau$,
  then $\Sigma$ cannot deduce $\tau$. Therefore, $\Sigma \not \models \tau$.

\end{Answer}

\begin{problem}[2]
  Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be theories (in the same language $\cL$) such that:
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item $T_1 \subseteq T_2$.
    \item $T_1$ is complete.
    \item $T_2$ is satisfiable.
  \end{enumroman}
  Show that $T_1 = T_2$.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  
  $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both theories, meaning if $T_1$ deduces any wff
  $\phi$ then $\phi$ is a member of $T_1$ and, similarly,
  if $T_2$ deduces any wff $\phi$ then $\phi$ is a member of $T_2$.
  Furthermore, $T_1$ is complete, meaning that for any wff $\gamma$ definable
  in the language $\cL$, either $T_1$ deduces $\gamma$ or $T_1$ deduces
  $\lnot \gamma$. By (1), for every such $\gamma$ definable in $\cL$,
  $T_1$ either contains $\gamma$ or $T_1$ contains $\lnot \gamma$.

  $T_1 \subseteq T_2$, so for every $\gamma$ definable in $\cL$,
  $T_2$ must also contain either $\gamma$ or $\lnot \gamma$
  (whichever is in $T_1$).
  Since $T_2$ is satisfiable, it cannot deduce
  (hence, cannot contain, since it is a theory) both $\gamma$ and $\lnot \gamma$
  for any wff $\gamma$. It can also not contain any sentences not
  true in $\cL$ since it is a theory for $\cL$.
  Therefore, $T_2$ must only contain the same wffs as those contained in
  the subset $T_1$, so $T_2 = T_1$.

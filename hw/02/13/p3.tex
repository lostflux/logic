\begin{problem}[7]
  Consider a language with a two-place predicate symbol $<$,
  and let $\fN = (\N; <)$ be the structure consisting of the natural numbers
  with their usual ordering. Show that there is some $\fA$ elementarily
  equivalent to $\fN$ such that $<^\fA$ has a descending chain.
  That is, there must be $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ such that
  $\vector{a_{i+1}, a_i} \in <^\fA$ for all $i$.

  \step
  \emph{Hint: } Apply the compactness theorem.

\begin{Answer}
  Let $\fA = (\N; <, c)$ be a structure consisting of the natural numbers
  under their usual ordering, with an additional
  constant symbol $c \notin \N$.
  Let
  \[ \Gamma = \set{x < c \mid x \in \N} = \set{0^\fA < c, 1^\fA < c, 2^\fA < c, \ldots}.\]
  For any finite subset of some size $k$,
  Mapping $x^\fA \mapsto x^\fN$ for all $x \in \N$, $x < k$
  and mapping $c^\fA \mapsto k^\fN$ gives a model of $\Gamma$
  that contains a descending chain of length $k$.

  Since every such finite subset of $\Gamma \cup \Th \fN$
  has a model, then by the compactness theorem
  $\Gamma \cup \Th \fN$ also has a model.
  But since the size of $\N$ is infinite,
  there exists a descending chain in $\fA$, starting with $c$, that
  has infinite length.

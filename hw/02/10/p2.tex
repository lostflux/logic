\begin{problem}
  Show that if $\fA$ and $\fB$ are countable structures for $\cL$
  in which infinitely many elements sre not named by constant symbols,
  and $\equiv_\fA$ is the same relation as $\equiv_\fB$,
  then $\fA$ is isomorphic to $\fB$.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Since $\equiv A$ is the same relation as $\equiv B$,
  $\fA$ and $\fB$ agree on which of the constants in $C$ name the same elements.

  \step
  Let $A = \set{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, \ldots}$ be the set of countable
  elements of $\fA$ that are not named by constant symbols,
  and let $B = \set{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n, \ldots}$ be the set of countable
  elements of $\fB$ that are not named by constant symbols.

  \step
  Define a bijection from $\abs{\fA}$ to $\abs{\fB}$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \psi : \abs{\fA} &\to \abs{\fB} \\
    c_n^\fA &\mapsto c_n^\fB \\
    a_i &\mapsto b_i
  \end{align*}

  \step
  Then $\psi$ is an isomorphism, since:
  \[
    c_n^\fA \equiv_\fA c_m^\fA \quad \quad \Iff \quad c_n^\fB \equiv_\fB c_m^\fB,
  \]
  but $c_n^\fB = \psi(c_n^\fA)$ and $c_m^\fB = \psi(c_m^\fA)$,
  so
  \[
    c_n^\fA \equiv_\fA c_m^\fA \quad \Iff \quad \psi(c_n^\fA) \equiv_\fB \psi(c_m^\fA).
  \]

  \step
  Since every element in $A$ and every element in $B$
  is not named by any constant symbol, and each element is distinct from
  all other elements in the set,
  each $a \in A$ is in its own equivalence class and so is each $b \in B$.
  $\psi$ matches element $a_i$ in $\fA$ to element $b_i$ in $\fB$,
  so it guarantees that any element in $[a_i]$ maps to an element in $[b_i]$
  (since $[a_i]$ only contains the single element $a_i$, and $\psi(a_i) = b_i$).
  Therefore, $a_i \equiv_\fA a_j$ if and only if $b_i \equiv_\fB b_j$,
  since in both cases it must be that $i = j$.

  \step
  Therefore $\psi$ is an isomorphism, and $\fA$ is isomorphic to $\fB$.

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $C$ with finitely many
  equivalence classes. Describe all the complete (consistent) theories
  of $T$ with the property that $Cn \Sigma_\equiv \subset T$, by saying
  what sentences you need to add to $\Sigma_\equiv$ to produce the set
  of axioms for $T$.

  \emph{Hint: } Consider the possible ways to get finite or infinite
  countable models of $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$ that are not isomorphic.
  Then consider whether these non-isomorphic structures have
  different theories.

  Since every complete theory of $\cL$ contains some $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$
  (because every structure for $fL$ satisfies some $\Sigma_\equiv$),
  problems (4) and (5) together describe all the complete theories of $\cL$.

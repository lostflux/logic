\begin{problem}
  Show that if $\fA$ is any finite structure for $\cL$, there is a countable
  structure $\fB$ such that $\fB$ is elementarily equivalent to $\fA$,
  and in $\fB$, infinitely many elements are not named by constant symbols.
  In other words, we have that
  \[ \set{b \in \abs{\fB} \mid \forall n (b \ne c_n^\fB)} \] is infinite.
  (\emph{Hint: } Use compactness.)

  \crim{
    \textbf{Compactness Theorem: } If $\Gamma \models \phi$,
    then for some finite $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$,
    $\Gamma_0 \models \phi$.
  (In other words, a set $\Gamma$ has a model iff every finite subset
  has a model)\\
  \textbf{Elementary equivalence: } Two structures $\fA$ and $\fB$ are
  \emph{elementarily equivalent} if
  $\quad \models_\fA \alpha \Iff \models_\fB \alpha$,
}

\begin{Answer}
  Let $\fA$ be a \emph{finite} structure for $\cL$
  such that $\abs{\fA} \ne \infty$.

  \step
  Define $\fB$ as such
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item Include translations of the constant symbols from
      $C$ in $\abs{\fB}$. That is; for each $c_n \in C$,
      $c_n^\fB \in \abs{\fB}$.\\
      Whenever $c_m^\fA = c_n^\fA$, let $c_m^\fB = c_n^\fB$
      so that  $c_m \equiv_\fB c_n$ if and only if $c_m =_\fA c_n$.
    \item Define a new set of countably many elements
      $B = \set{b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n, \ldots}$ such that:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall i \forall j \lnot (b_i = c_j)$.
        \item $\forall i \forall j (i = j \lor \lnot (b_i = b_j))$.
      \end{itemize}
    \item For each $b_i \in B$, let $b_i^\fB \in \abs{\fB}$.
  \end{enumroman}

  \step
  Then $\fB$ is an infinite structure for $\cL$ that is elementarily
  equivalent to $\fA$.

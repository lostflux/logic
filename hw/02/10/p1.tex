\begin{problem}[6]
  Show that the formula $\theta$ is valid iff $\forall x \theta$ is valid.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  $\Longrightarrow$

  \step
  Suppose $\theta$ is valid, we show that $\forall x \theta$ is also valid.

  \step
  Let $\frakA$ be a structure and $s : V \lto \abs{\frakA}$ be an assignment function.
  Since $\theta$ is valid, $\models_{\frakA} \theta [s]$.\\
  Then for all $a \in \abs{\frakA}$, we have that $\models_{\frakA} \forall x \theta [s (x|a)]$.

  \step
  Since $s$ and $\frakA$ are arbitrary, it must be that $\models \forall x \theta$,
  meaning $\forall x \theta$ is valid.

  \step
  $\Longleftarrow$

  \step
  Suppose $\forall x \theta$ is valid, we show that $\theta$ is also valid.

  \step
  Let $\frakA$ be a structure and $s : V \lto \abs{\frakA}$ be an assignment function.
  Since $\forall x \theta$ is valid, we have that $\models_{\frakA} \forall x \theta [s]$.\\
  Then $\models_{\frakA} \theta [s(x | s(x))]$.

  \step
  But $s(x | s(x)) = s$, so $\models_{\frakA} \theta [s]$, meaning $\theta$ is valid.

\begin{problem}
  Show that if $\fA$ is any finite structure for $\cL$, there is a countable
  structure $\fB$ such that $\fB$ is elementarily equivalent to $\fA$,
  and in $\fB$, infinitely many elements are not named by constant symbols.
  In other words, we have that
  \[ \set{b \in \abs{\fB} \mid \forall n (b \ne c_n^\fB)} \] is infinite.
  (\emph{Hint: } Use compactness.)

    \textbf{Compactness Theorem: } If $\Gamma \models \phi$,
    then for some finite $\Gamma_0 \subseteq \Gamma$,
    $\Gamma_0 \models \phi$.\\
  (In other words, a set $\Gamma$ has a model iff every finite subset
  has a model)

\begin{problem}
  Suppose $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $C$. Define
  \[ \Sigma_\equiv = \set{ c_n = c_m \mid c_m \equiv c_n}
      \cup \set{c_n \ne c_m \mid c_n \nequiv c_m }. \]

  Show that if $\equiv$ has infinitely many equivalence classes, then
  $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$ is a complete theory.

  \emph{Suggestion: } Explain why $\fA$ is a model of $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$
  if and only if $\equiv_\fB$ is the same relation as $\equiv$.
  Then use (2) and (3) to show that if $\fA$ and $\fB$ are
  any two models for $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$, then there are structures
  $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ elementarily equivalent to $\fA$ and $\fB$
  such that $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ are isomorphic.

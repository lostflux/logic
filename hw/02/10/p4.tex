\def \seq {\Sigma_\equiv}
\begin{problem}
  Suppose $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $C$. Define
  \[ \Sigma_\equiv = \set{ c_n = c_m \mid c_m \equiv c_n}
      \cup \set{c_n \ne c_m \mid c_n \nequiv c_m }. \]

  Show that if $\equiv$ has infinitely many equivalence classes, then
  $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$ is a complete theory.

  \emph{Suggestion: } Explain why $\fA$ is a model of $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$
  if and only if $\equiv_\fB$ is the same relation as $\equiv$.
  Then use (2) and (3) to show that if $\fA$ and $\fB$ are
  any two models for $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$, then there are structures
  $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ elementarily equivalent to $\fA$ and $\fB$
  such that $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ are isomorphic.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Suppose $\fA$ is a model for $\Sigma_\equiv$.
  If $\fA$ satisfies $\Sigma_\equiv$ under some variable assignment
  $s$, then for any two constant symbols $c_m$ and $c_n$,
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item If $\models_\fA c_m \equiv c_n [s]$,
      then $\Sigma_\equiv$ contains a sentence
      that says $c_m = c_n$. So, by definition of $\equiv_\fA$,
      we also have that $c_m \equiv_\fA c_n$.
    \item If $\models_\fA c_m \nequiv c_n [s]$,
      then $\Sigma_\equiv$ contains a sentence that says $c_m \ne c_n$,
      so $c_m \nequiv_\fA c_n$.
  \end{enumroman}
  Therefore, 
  if $[c_i]_\equiv$ is the equivalence class of $c_i$ under $\equiv$,
  and $[c_i]_{\equiv_\fA}$ is the equivalence class of $c_i$ under
  $\equiv_\fA$, then $[c_i]_\equiv = [c_i]_{\equiv_\fA}$
  since the two equivalence relations agree on any two constants being in
  the same equivalence class or not being in the same class.
  Therefore, $\equiv$ and $\equiv_\fA$ are the same relation.

  \bigskip
  Now, suppose $\fA$ and $\fB$ are models for $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$,
  then $\equiv_\fA$ is the same same relation as $\equiv$, and $\equiv_\fB$
  is also the same relation as $\equiv$, meaning $\equiv_\fA$ is the same
  relation as $\equiv_\fB$.
  Extend $\fA$ and $\fB$ to $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ respectively
  by adding new, distinct symbols as in the proof of problem (2).
  That is, for each $i \in \N$, we define $a_i$ to be a new symbol
  that does not yet exist in $\abs{\fA}$, and $b_i$ to be a new
  symbol that does not yet exist in $\abs{\fB}$.
  We then define $\abs{\fA^*} = \abs{\fA} \cup \set{a_i \mid i \in \N}$
  and $\abs{\fB^*} = \abs{\fB} \cup \set{b_i \mid i \in \N}$.
  Then $\fA^*$ and $\fB^*$ are models for $Cn \Sigma_\equiv$,
  $\fA^*$ is elementarily equivalent to $\fA$, $\fB^*$ is elementarily
  equivalent to $\fB$, and $\fA^*$ is isomorphic to $\fB^*$
  since they have the same cardinality and $\equiv_\fA$ is the same
  relation as $\equiv_\fB$.

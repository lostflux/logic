\bigskip
For this assignment, $\calL$ is the language of first-order logic with equality,
countably many constant symbols, $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n, \ldots$, and no other
predicate, constant, or function symbols.
We will find all the complete theories of $\calL$.
This is a single problem in five parts.
You may use completeness, soundness, and compactness.

If $\fA$ is a structure for $\calL$, define an equivalence relation on the set
$C = \set{c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n, \ldots }$ of constant symbols of $\calL$
by \[ c_m \equiv_\fA c_n \Iff c_m^\fA = c_n^\fA, \]
That is, two constant symbols are equivalent if and only if they name the
same element of $\fA$.

Suppose that $\fA$ and $\fB$ are structures such that $\equiv_\fA$
is the same as $\equiv_\fB$.
Then two constant symbols name the same element in $\fA$ if and only if
they name the same element in $\fB$.

Let $\equiv$ be any equivalence relation on $C$.
Then there is a structure $\fA$ for $\cL$ such that $\equiv_\fA$
is the same relation as $\equiv$. Namely, let the universe of the structure
be the set of equivalence classes of constant symbols, and let each
constant symbol name its own equivalence class:
\[ \abs{\fA} = C / \equiv, \quad \text{ and } \quad \quad c_n^\fA = [c_n]. \]

The most complicated part of this is the notation.
The relation $\equiv$ on $C$ specifies whether constants $c_n$ and $c_m$
are to refer to the same element of a structure or to different elements.
Therefore, as long as $\equiv$ actually is an equivalence relation,
you can create a structure obeying those rules.

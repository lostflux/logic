\begin{problem}
  With the same definitions as in problem (2),
  let $\frakB$ be the \emph{reduct} of $\frakB^*$ to a structure
  for $\calL$. This means that:
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{\fB} &= \abs{\fB^*} \\
    f^{\fB} &= f^{\fB^*} \\
    P^\fB &= P^{\fB^*}
  \end{align*}

  \step
  In other words, $\fB$ translates every parameter $\calL$
  in exactly the same way as $\fB^*$.
  It merely has no translation for $E$, since $E$ is not a symbol of
  $\calL$. (Of course, $\fB$ must translate $=$ as equality).

  \step
  Because $\fB^*$ translated $E$ as equality, we can conclude that
  for any wff $\alpha$ of $\calL$ and variable assignment $\sbar$
  for $\fB$, since $\alpha^*$ is $\alpha$ with $E$ replaced by $=$,
  \[ \fB \models \alpha [\sbar ] \Iff \fB^* \models \alpha^*[\sbar]. \]
  This makes sense because $\fB$ and $\fB^*$ have the same universe,
  so $\sbar$ is also a variable assignment for $\fB$.

  \step
  By problem (2),
  \[ \fB^* \models \alpha [h \circ s] \Iff \fA^* \models \alpha^* [s], \]
  and therefore
  \[ \fB \models \alpha [h \circ s] \Iff \fA^8 \models \alpha^* [s]. \]

  \step
  We conclude that if $\Sigma$ is any set of formulas of $\calL$
  including all the logical axioms in groups $5$ and $6$,
  and the set $\Sigma^*$ (obtained by replacing $=$ with $E$
  in every element of $Sigma$) is satisfiable
  by some structure $\fA^*$ and variable assignment $s$,
  then the original set $\Sigma$ is also satisfiable by the structure
  $\fB$ and variable assignment $h \circ s$ as defined in problem (2).

  \step
  Using problem (1) and the further context, show that if every consistent
  set of sentences in $\calL^*$ is satisfiable then every consistent set of
  sentences in $\calL$ is satisfiable.

\begin{problem}
  Let $\calL$ be a language for first-order logic, including the equality symbol
  (and any number of other symbols),
  and $\calL^*$ be $\calL$ without the equality symbol,
  but with an additional $2$-place predicate symbol $E$.
  For any formula $\alpha$ of $\calL$, define $\alpha^*$ to be the formula
  of $\calL^*$ obtained from$\alpha$ by replacing every occurrence of
  $=$ with $E$. If $\Sigma$ is a set of formulas of $\calL$,
  define \[ \Sigma^* = \set{ a^* \mid a \in \Sigma }. \]

    \item This is a short answer problem.\\
      For which logical axiom groups is it true that $\alpha$ is a logical
      axiom in that group if and only if $\alpha^*$ is a logical axiom in
      that group?

        \item If $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$
          is a deduction from $\Sigma$ in the language $\calL$
          then $\alpha^*_1, \alpha^*_2, \ldots, \alpha^*_n$

        \item If $\alpha^*_1, \alpha^*_2, \ldots, \alpha^*_n$
          is a deduction from $\Sigma^*$ in the language $\calL^*$
          then $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$

    \item Show that if $\Sigma$ is a consistent set of formulas in $\calL$
      then $\Sigma^*$ is a consistent set of formulas in $\calL^*$.\\
      You may use your answers in (a) and (b).\\
      \emph{Hint: } Recall that $\Sigma$ is inconsistent if there is
      some $\alpha$ such that $\Sigma \deduces \alpha$ and
      $\Sigma \deduces \lnot \alpha$.

    \item Show by example that it is possible for $\Sigma$ to be inconsistent
      but $\Sigma^*$ to be consistent.

\begin{problem}[8]
  Assume the language (with equality) has just the parameters
  $\forall$ and $P$, where $P$ is a two-place predicate symbol.
  Let $\fA$ be the structure with $\abs{\fA} = \Z$,
  the set of the integers (positive, negative, zero)
  and with $\vector{a, b} \in P^\fA$ iff $\abs{a - b}~=~1$.

  \step
  Thus, $\fA$ looks like an infinite graph:
  \begin{align*}
    \cdots
    \longleftrightarrow \bullet
    \longleftrightarrow \bullet
    \longleftrightarrow \bullet
    \longleftrightarrow \cdots
  \end{align*}
  Show that there is an elementarily equivalent structure $\fB$ that is not
  connected (being \emph{connected} means that for every two members of
  $\abs{\fB}$, there is a path between them. A path --- of length $n$ ---
  is a sequence $\vector{p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_n}$ of elements of $\abs{\fB}$
  such that $a = p_0$ and $b = p_n$ and $\vec{p_i, p_{i+1}} \in P^\fB$
  for each $i$).

  \step
  Write down sentences saying $c$ and $d$ are far apart,
  applying compactness.

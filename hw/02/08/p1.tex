\begin{problem}[2]
  Prove the equivalence of parts (a) and (b) of the completeness theorem.

  \step
  \emph{Suggestion: } $\Gamma \models \phi$ iff $\Gamma \cup \set{\lnot \phi}$
    is unsatisfiable. And $\Delta$ is satisfiable iff $\Delta \ne \bot$,
    where $\bot$ is some unsatisfiable, refutable formula
    like $\lnot \forall x x = x$.
    (Similarly, the soundness theorem is equivalent to the statement
    that every satisfiable set of formulas is consistent.)
